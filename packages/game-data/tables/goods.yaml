# 9‑D vector order = [MAT, CAL, COM, PRE, DUR, TEC, LAB, CAP, WGT]
# 1 MAT	Material affinity	[1,0,0] one‑hot for wood / metal / organic then PCA‑compressed to 1 scalar (cheap dimensionality saving).	
# 2 CAL	Consumable energy / utility	Calories for food & drink, or 0 for non‑consumables; log‑scaled so bread≈1, shark≈3.	
# 3 COM	Comfort / fashion	0–10 subjective QoL bump (clothes 4‑6, furniture 7‑9).	
# 4 PRE	Prestige / rarity	Captures status signalling; base = log(market price / base price).	
# 5 DUR	Durability / lifespan	Expected uses or days before replacement (food 1, bread 2, wagon 1 200).	
# 6 TEC	Tech factor	Minimum tech tier (0 primitive → 4 advanced).	
# 7 LAB	Direct labour- hours per unit	Normalised to 1 = one low‑skill hour.	
# 8 CAP	Machine slots required	Fractions allowed (0.2 oven‑minutes etc.).	
# 9 WGT	Mass / bulk	Simplified shipping cost driver (kg or volume index).
