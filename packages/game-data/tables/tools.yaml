# ---------- tools.yaml ----------
# One row = one craftable/equippable tool.
# Final stats are derived at runtime:
#   final_gather_speed = baseSpeed   × material.harvestSpeedMult × quality.gatherSpeedMult × repairState.gatherSpeedMult
#   final_durability   = baseDurability × material.durabilityMult × quality.durabilityMult
#
# Fields
# ───────
# toolClass   – what gameplay system uses it  (“pickaxe”, “hatchet”, etc.)
# material    – default material when generated (can be overridden)
# baseSpeed   – baseline gather speed multiplier (1.0 = reference pickaxe)
# baseDurability – reference durability before material/quality factors
# weightBase  – kg before material.weightFactor multiplier
